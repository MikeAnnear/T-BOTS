Requires pyBlues, and opencv.

Delete pathpoints.dat to create a new path. When you run either TBot_HSVTracking_BT.py or TBotTrackerBT.py, an image is captured which you can click on to create your own data points.

TBot_HSVTracking_BT.py and TBot_HSVTracking_BT_FuncGen.py both use colour tracking in the HSV colour space.

TBotTrackerBT.py uses cv2.selectROI() to allow the user to select an object to track. 


This is in the very early stages of development but I thought some of you might enjoy the challenge of improving it yourselves. Please let me know how you get on.

I will add a series of tutorials on computer vision in the near future.
