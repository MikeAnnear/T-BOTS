This app is required if you want to use TBotWithPlottingOverBT. This doesn't perform quite as well as the combination of Bluetooth Joystick Commander and the T-Bot.ino sketch but it is useful for tuning.

This is a test version for you to try on your Android device. Simply copy the apk file to your phone or tablet and install it. 

If you would like to develop your own app, you can create an account with MIT App Inventor and import the aia file. Maybe you can see a way of boosting the performance!
