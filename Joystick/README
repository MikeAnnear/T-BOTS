This software allows you to use a wireless USB controller to control the T-Bot. The controller commands are converted to T-Bot commands and sent over Bluetooth.

Trim:   Triangle/X
KPS:    Square/Circle
Slow:   R2

You can control the T-Bot with both left and right joysticks. The right stick gives slower finer control. Using the left stick for speed and the right stick for steering works very well.
